# Chore App

## Description

This Chore App is designed to manage and track chores completed by children, with each chore having a dollar value. The application aims to eventually run on a Raspberry Pi in kiosk mode with a touchscreen interface.

  - Parents can create, list, and assign chores with dollar values.
  - Children can view and mark chores as complete.
  
- **Chore Management**: Add, view, and complete chores. 

- **Daily Summaries**: End-of-day reports for parent approval.

- **Data Persistence**: Data retention even in case of power failures.

## Installation
